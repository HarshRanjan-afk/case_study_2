## Temperature_Monitorng_Harsh_Ranjan_202501100700190_B
This Python program takes minimum and maximum temperature limits from the user and generates a random temperature (0–100) every 2 seconds.
It compares the value with the limits and displays whether the temperature is too high, too low, or within the acceptable range.
